# paradyse
Paradyse it's a python discord bot that has slash commands that work in GroupChats, DMs, Servers(without being invited) etc.
## ‚ùó‚ùó This is just the starting-code so you can get used to it. I do not provide the full source.

### ‚ùî How to make it work:
 - **Step 1**: Create your application in the *Discord Developer Portal*
  
 - **Step 2**: Go to *Installation Page* -> Scroll Down and press on *Guild Install* then press to add the **bot** option. Select "Administrator" for your permissions.
  
 - **Step 3**: Go to *OAuth2* page and copy your client id, put it in your cogs/info.py file
  
 - **Step 4**: Go to *General Information* and copy your application id and paste it in cogs/info.py file
  
 - **Step 5**: Go to *Bot* and turn on all of this 3 intents ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b038c02e-deb3-4981-9e17-99ec8f0c3cca)
  
 - **Step 6**: Click save and then copy your token.
  
 - **Step 7**: Create a .env file in your folder and write "TOKEN = your_token"
  
 - **Step 8**: Install the requirements (i forgot them :skull:)

 - **Step 9**: Run your bot

## ‚ùó If you started the bot and you DID install it in your apps/guild and you DO NOT see the slash commands, CTRL + R in the discord. 
## ‚ùó Also i think it has a bug for its own pfp.
